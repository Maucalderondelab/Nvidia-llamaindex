# AI Property Agent

## Project Overview
The AI Property Agent aims to simplify the complex process of renting or buying a home in big cities. Drawing from personal experiences of dealing with numerous landlords, writing countless emails, and managing exhausting follow-ups, this project will create an AI agent to streamline the property search and communication process.

An innovative AI-powered agent designed to revolutionize the property search experience. By leveraging advanced Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, our agent assists users in finding and contacting suitable properties for rent or purchase with unprecedented accuracy and personalization.
